Step 1:

1.1  Download genome sequence from NCBI

NCBI :  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Strain name :  Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501   
Taxonomy ID : 379731

1.2 Upload genome sequence to RAST and construct the draft model

RAST :  http://rast.nmpdr.org/
ModelSEED :  http://modelseed.org/
RAST and ModelSEED Account (same):
    User :  yuanqianqian
    Password :  123456

Step 2:

2.1 Log in  http://49.4.23.198:8888/
   password: 123456
   
2.2 Create folder for yourself, name it use your own name

2.3 Copy qualitycontrol-workflow-eng.ipynb and metnet.py to your own folder.

Then run the file of  qualitycontrol-workflow-eng.ipynb to revise the draft model step by step.
